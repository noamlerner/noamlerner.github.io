						<h1 style="margin-left:60%">About</h1>
						<p style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">I started programming in the begginning of my junior year of highschool (September 2013) in the only class my school offered on the subject which was taught in C#.
						I quickly fell in love with it and took it on my own to learn and do as much as possible.</p>

							<h2> Languages</h2>
							<p>Although my favorite and probably most used languages so far have been Java and typescript, I have used many languages including C#, Objective-C, and PHP but I feel that one is not limited by the lagnuages he has already used. I am willing and eager to learn any language that will help get my current project accomplished! When I needed to write client-side scripts, I sat down and read the documentation for php. When I wanted my webpage to be a little more flashy, I sat down and learned JavaScript. And when a friend came to me and asked to make a game in TypeScript, I took a week to learn that langauge as well. </p>
